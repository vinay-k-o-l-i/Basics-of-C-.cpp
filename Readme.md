### Aim

To write a C++ program that:

- Prints Hello World as the first output.
- Takes two numbers from the user.
- Performs and displays addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Tools

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- iostream header file
- Keyboard for input

# Explanation of the C++ Hello World Code
This program is a basic C++ application that prints the phrase "Hello world:" to the screen.
- #include<iostream>  
  This line tells the compiler to include the Input-Output stream library, which is necessary for using cout to print output.
- using namespace std;  
  This allows us to use standard library features directly without prefixing them with std::.
- int main()  
  The main function is the entry point of every C++ program. It returns an integer to the operating system upon completion.
- { ... }  
  The braces define the start and end of the main function's body.
- cout << "Hello world:";  
  This line prints the text "Hello world:" to the console.
- return 0;  
  This statement signals that the program finished successfully.

  # Explanation of the C++ Calculator Program
This program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, division, and subtraction) on two numbers entered by the user.
- #include<iostream>  
  Includes the input-output stream library for using cin and cout.
- using namespace std;  
  Allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with std::.

- int main()  
  The main function where the program execution starts.

- Variables:  
  float num1, num2, sum, Div, sub;  
  These variables store the two input numbers and the results of the arithmetic operations.

- Input:  
  The program prompts the user to enter two numbers using cout and reads them with cin.

- Operations:  
  - sum = num1 + num2; Adds the two numbers.  
  - Div = num1 / num2; Divides the first number by the second.  
  - sub = num1 - num2; Subtracts the second number from the first.

- Output:  
  Each result is printed to the console using cout followed by endl to move to a new line.

- return 0;  
  Indicates the program finished successfully.

  # Conclusion:
The basics of C++ was seen through the programs.
