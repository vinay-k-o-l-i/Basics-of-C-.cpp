### Aim

To write a C++ program that:

- Prints Hello World as the first output.
- Takes two numbers from the user.
- Performs and displays addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Tools

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- iostream header file
- Keyboard for input

# Explanation of the C++ Hello World Code
This program is a basic C++ application that prints the phrase "Hello world:" to the screen.
- #include<iostream>  
  This line tells the compiler to include the Input-Output stream library, which is necessary for using cout to print output.
- using namespace std;  
  This allows us to use standard library features directly without prefixing them with std::.
- int main()  
  The main function is the entry point of every C++ program. It returns an integer to the operating system upon completion.
- { ... }  
  The braces define the start and end of the main function's body.
- cout << "Hello world:";  
  This line prints the text "Hello world:" to the console.
- return 0;  
  This statement signals that the program finished successfully.
